This application is used for personal notes, homelab documentation etc.

It will hopefully prevent the future OneNote apocalypse.


## initial configuration

Default admin login is `admin@admin.com` with `password`, make sure to adjust them after login.
To allow registration of new users without configuring email validation, neither set `domain restriction` nor `Email confirmation`.
To disable registration, make sure to still not set either of them - else the already registered users are asked for email validation and are blocked after login.
