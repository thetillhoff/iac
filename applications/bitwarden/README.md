# bitwarden

A selfhosted password-manager-server to make sure my passwords are kept *really* safe.


## initial setup

There is a special config to enable user registration - use it for the initial users, then disable registration completely.


## client configuration

Make sure to set the server-url to your actual server-url - by default this is the official/"public" bitwarden server.
